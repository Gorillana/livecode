ðŸ‘‹ Hi!! You can find my music @ beats.thewebivore.com for
free cuz I hate ads, but I will be publishing some tracks to streaming
services in the near future cuz now I have a small hosting bill ðŸ’ž

I also have an email list at buttondown.email/pamselle

This set is inspired by tracks made in the last few months,
and some other tracks that were composed prior but have
interestingly relevant names (sourdough, germs).
