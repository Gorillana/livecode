# Pam's Home for Live Code

## What's this?

The files are the source, saved at the end of a recording/jam, of music made with [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Welcome), which is a means of live coding music in the Haskell language using the SuperDirt synth.

## Organization

- curiosities: things in progress, other people's files, experimentation, scripts

##  Updating the site

Run `node generate.js` which will generate the site from the `songs` directory, and push the update to S3.
